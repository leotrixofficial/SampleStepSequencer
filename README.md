# SampleStepSequencer
A very basic sample step sequencer I made in Java.

Current features:
  -Sequencer steps
  -Tempo/BPM slider
  
Planned future features:
  -Step indicators
  -Sample decay (envelope control/ADSR)
  -Sample pitch control
  -Drag and drop samples
  -Multiple step lanes

This is my first ever git repository. Don't judge. lol. :P
